## Repository Structure

The repository consists of several files that encompass different deep learning models and techniques used for glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) detection and segmentation. Below is a brief description of each file:

1. **DeepLabV3+ ResNet + Dice Loss GLOF Detection**
   - Implementation of the DeepLabV3+ model with a ResNet backbone, utilizing the Dice loss function for improved segmentation accuracy.

2. **DeepLabV3+ ResNet + Crossentropy GLOF Detection**
   - A variant of the DeepLabV3+ model also based on ResNet, this version employs cross-entropy loss for training, aimed at optimizing pixel-wise classification.

3. **Inference yolov8-seg GLOF Detection**
   - Code for performing inference using the YOLOv8 segmentation model to detect glacial lakes and assess the associated risks of GLOF.

4. **lake_segmentation_yolov8_old**
   - An older implementation of the YOLOv8 model for lake segmentation, which may contain different hyperparameters or architectural choices from the latest version.

5. **U-Net + EfficientNetB0 GLOF Detection**
   - This file implements a U-Net architecture with an EfficientNetB0 backbone, designed for pixel-level segmentation of glacial lakes. The model employs cross-entropy loss and achieves an IoU score of 69.1%.

6. **U-Net GLOF - Paper Replication**
   - A codebase focused on replicating findings from an existing paper utilizing U-Net for GLOF segmentation tasks.

7. **U-Net + ResNet Backbone GLOF Detection**
   - An implementation of U-Net using a ResNet backbone, designed to leverage ResNet's feature extraction capabilities for better segmentation performance.

8. **YoloV8-Seg, IoU GLOF Detection**
   - Implementation of the YOLOv8 model focused on segmentation tasks with a focus on optimizing the IoU score, showcasing its application in GLOF detection.
